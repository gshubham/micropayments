       p A micropayment is an e-commerce transaction involving a very small sum of money in exchange for something made available online, such as an application download, a service or Web-based content. 
       p Different companies define their own maximum allowable amount for a micropayment. For example, PayPal defines a micropayment as any payment less than $12 while Visa defines it as any payment less than $20. 
       p PayPal charges special rates of $0.05 and 5% for handling micropayments while its rates are $0.30 and 2.9% for normal payments. 
       p Micropayments are becoming increasingly popular for payments in the e-commerce sector because they can be used in situations where collecting such small amounts of money with the usual payment systems is impractical, or very expensive, in terms of the amount of money being collected.
